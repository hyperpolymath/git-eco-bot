# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity
and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes
* Focusing on what is best for the overall community
* Considering ecological and economic impacts of technical decisions

Examples of unacceptable behavior:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate

## Ecological & Economic Responsibility

As a project focused on ecological and economic code analysis, we also expect:

* Consideration of the environmental impact of contributions
* Respect for sustainable computing practices
* Thoughtful discussion of trade-offs between different approaches
* Recognition that economic efficiency includes long-term sustainability

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards
and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any
behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at:

* GitHub: Open an issue with the `conduct` label

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved for a specified period. This includes
avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period.
